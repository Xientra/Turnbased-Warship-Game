Primary Gameplay Loop:

you can basically allways attack so the goal is to find positions that:

(1) let you deal more dmg
	get in position to fire the Warship Laser
	get enemies in a certian position?
(2) take less dmg
	take cover behind astroids / in astroid fields
	get shielded / pretected by other ships


To test this easy lets start with both sides having two (2 tile) units.
One dmg dealer and one tank / support that can give shields or tank shots / draw fire








Stats:
	Defence: flat damage reduction
	Evasion: makes you harder to hit

	Damage: flat damage
	Accuracy: how likely it is to hit


	then there are aoe attacks that allways hit. Only at the edges of the aoe do you have the opportunity to miss?

	it does not make sense for giant warships to evade though.

	hull: health
	Shields: idk, maybe resistance to certian attacks. so yu need shield breaker and hull damager


Different Types of stuff an actual warship has:

	Offensive:
	- Standart Lasers Cannons
	- Standart Cannons
	- Missiles
	- Line Laser
	- Heat Laser 
	- emp attacks (malevolence)

	Defensive:
	- Hull integrity
	- (Spherical or On-Hull) Shield
	- external shield wall
	- interceptor missiles
