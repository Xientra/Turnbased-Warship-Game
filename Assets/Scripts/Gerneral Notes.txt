Primary Gameplay Loop:

you can basically allways attack so the goal is to find positions that:

(1) let you deal more dmg
	get in position to fire the Warship Laser
	get enemies in a certian position?
(2) take less dmg
	take cover behind astroids / in astroid fields
	get shielded / pretected by other ships


To test this easy lets start with both sides having two (2 tile) units.
One dmg dealer and one tank / support that can give shields or tank shots / draw fire















Warship (M2, L10) armor or sth
- Laser: Shot laser in a straight line dealing 3-5 dmg to the first target and 1 less with each hit
- Breadside: Dealing 1 dmg to any tile (or in a 30t radius idk)

Interceptor (M7, L3) evasion or sth
- Pew Pew: deal 3 dmg to any tile in a 5t radius

Bomber (M5, L3)
- Bombs: deal 5-8 dmg to any tile in a 2t radius
